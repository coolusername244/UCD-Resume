# End of Module Summar

During this project, we have utilised a range of components from HTML and CSS and while at the same time, diving further into Bootstraps abilities. 

During the time of this module, I was also able to schedule in the first meeting with Gerry who will be my mentor for the future milestone projects I will be undertaking.
